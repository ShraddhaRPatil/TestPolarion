    <field id="text" text-type="text/plain">I do not follow the title of this topic as "Traceability and Consistency" when the majority of the slides cover the mechanics of suspects.  Surely Traceability is more than the absence of suspects.  The concept of suspects is also somewhat ambiguous to me - I would understand it better if there were an example of suspected work item(s) that are followed throughout all the slides. </field>
