<!-- TERMINOLOGY:
Source Document: the Document the user is merging content FROM
Source item: a Work Item contained in the Source Document
Target Document: the Document the user is merging content TO
Target item: a Work item contained in or appearing via reference in the Target Document
Overwritten item: a Work Item in the target Document that is referenced from the source Document, but the content is changed in the target Document.
 
This file specifies which actions are available for the target Document in the Merge sidebar when comparing two Documents. 
The actions can be specified for global and/or project configurations. Actions can be allowed conditionally. See the example <condition> elements 
in the actions below, and "CONDITIONS INFORMATION" at the end of this file.

<!-- CONDITIONS INFORMATION:
    
    * Only one <conditions> element is allowed within any <action> element. Any that apear after the first one are ignored. 
    * The <conditions> element can contain multiple <condition> elements.
    * You can construct complex conditions by using nested <and>, <or>, and <not> tags within a <condition> element. 
    * A <condition> can contain multiple <not> tags, the result being as if they were enclosed by an "<and>" tag. So the <not> tag actually works like a "NAND" logical operator.
    * Empty <and>, <or> tags evaluate to "true".
    * Empty <not> tags evaluates to "false".
    * Unknown or invalid elements and tags, and <condition> elements having an unknown/invalid "id" attribute value are ignored.
    * A <condition> element having one of the following values specified in its "id" attribute can contain a Lucene query on the respective artifact:
        - com.polarion.sourceWorkItemQuery (the <condition> value should be a Lucene query on the attributes of the Source Work Item)
        - com.polarion.targetWorkItemQuery (the <condition> value should be a Lucene query on the attributes of the Target Work Item)
        - com.polarion.sourceDocumentQuery (the <condition> value should be a Lucene query on the attributes of the Source Document)
        - com.polarion.targetDocumentQuery (the <condition> value should be a Lucene query on the attributes of the Target Document)
		
        Examples:
        <condition id="com.polarion.sourceWorkItemQuery">type:requirement AND NOT status:in-review</condition>
        <condition id="com.polarion.targetDocumentQuery">type:test-specification AND status:draft</condition>
        Notes:
        - If the query is empty, the condition is ignored.
        - If the query is defined, for example, for the target item, and that item is null, the condition is ignored.
