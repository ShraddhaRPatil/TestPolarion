    <field id="description" text-type="text/html">&lt;span style="font-style: italic;" class="Apple-style-span"&gt;Describe the needs of typical customers or market segments, including needs that are not yet met by the marketplace or by existing systems. You may wish to describe problems customers currently encounter that the new product will (or will not) address and how the product would be used by customers. Identify the customer hardware and software environment in which the product must operate. Define at a high level any known critical interface or performance requirements. Avoid including any design or implementation details. Present the requirements in a numbered list so that more detailed user or functional requirements can be traced to them.&lt;/span&gt;</field>
