    Build Work Item reports configuration
    =====================================
    Using element <workitem-report> you can list some Work Items in the build preview and notification.
    Typical usage is to list Work Items that were resolved since previous build.
    There may be several Work Item reports (each corresponding to one <workitem-report> element), each report
    will occurr as a new section in the build preview and notification (below section "Build Results").
    
    <workitem-report>
      By attributes buildArtifact and buildDescriptor you can define for which artifacts and build descriptors
      this report definition applies. The Work Items will be listed only on previews of builds that match this 
      criteria. 
        buildArtifact 
          Artifact selector in format ARTIFACT_GROUP_ID:ARTIFACT_ID:REPOSITORY_TAG, where 
          any of the three parts may end with '*' to indicate matching by prefix (leave part empty or equal 
          to '*' to match all artifacts). 
        buildDescriptor 
          Name of the build descriptor. If the attribute is missing, all descriptors are matched.
        

      <linkRole>
        Id of the report, unique among work reports in a project.
      <title>
        Title of the section.
      <query>
        This element contains query that together with attributes of this element determines which 
        Work Items are listed.
        String ${build.stamp} in query will be replaced by current build stamp (this might be useful
        in case you are maintaining some custom field with build relevant information).
        Attributes (only one of resolved* criteria may be used):
            currentProjectOnly (true or false)
                - include only Work Items from the current project
            resolvedSinceLastSuccessfulBuild (true or false)
                - include only Work Items resolved since last successfull build of the artifact in case
            resolvedSinceBuild (build stamp)
                - include only Work Items resolved since build with given stamp
            resolvedSince (time in the format YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM)
                - include only Work Items resolved since given time
            resolvedInLastDays (positive integer)
                - include only Work Items resolved in last n days
      <sort-by>
        This element can have one or more subelements <field>, that may determine sorting of the items list
        in descending or ascending order (boolean attribute descending).

    Example:

        <workitem-report buildArtifact="*:*:*">
            <linkRole>resolved_requirements</linkRole>
            <title>Recently Resolved Requirements</title>
            <query currentProjectOnly="true" resolvedInLastDays="14">type:requirement</query>
            <sort-by>
                <field name="resolvedOn" descending="false"/>
            </sort-by>
        </workitem-report>

        <workitem-report buildArtifact="*:*:*">
            <linkRole>resolved_defects</linkRole>
            <title>Recently Resolved Defects</title>
            <query currentProjectOnly="true" resolvedInLastDays="14">type:defect</query>
            <sort-by>
                <field name="resolvedOn" descending="false"/>
            </sort-by>
        </workitem-report>
